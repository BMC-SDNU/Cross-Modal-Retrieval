# Local Graph Convolutional Networks for Cross-Modal Hashing
This repository contains the code of Local Graph Convolutional Networks Hashing (LGCNH) accepted at MM'21.

Part of the code is modified from [DCMH](https://github.com/jiangqy/DCMH-CVPR2017).

## Environment
MatConvNet (GPU version).

## Datasets
Please refer to [DCMH](https://github.com/jiangqy/DCMH-CVPR2017).

## Download the pre-trained networks
Download pre-trained [VGG-F](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/), and save it in './data'.

## Network initialization
Run generateFixParam.m

## Training and Testing
Run LGCNH_demo.m
