function [X, fX, i] = minimize(X, f, length, varargin)

% Minimize a differentiable multivariate function. 
%
% Usage: [X, fX, i] = minimize(X, f, length, P1, P2, P3, ... )
%
% where the starting point is given by "X" (D by 1), and the function named in
% the string "f", must return a function value and a vector of partial
% derivatives of f wrt X, the "length" gives the length of the run: if it is
% positive, it gives the maximum number of line searches, if negative its
% absolute gives the maximum allowed number of function evaluations. You can
% (optionally) give "length" a second component, which will indicate the
% reduction in function value to be expected in the first line-search (defaults
% to 1.0). The parameters P1, P2, P3, ... are passed on to the function f.
%
% The function returns when either its length is up, or if no further progress
% can be made (ie, we are at a (local) minimum, or so close that due to
% numerical problems, we cannot get any closer). NOTE: If the function
% terminates within a few iterations, it could be an indication that the
% function values and derivatives are not consistent (ie, there may be a bug in
% the implementation of your "f" function). The function returns the found
% solution "X", a vector of function values "fX" indicating the progress made
% and "i" the number of iterations (line searches or function evaluations,
% depending on the sign of "length") used.
%
% The Polack-Ribiere flavour of conjugate gradients is used to compute search
% directions, and a line search using quadratic and cubic polynomial
% approximations and the Wolfe-Powell stopping criteria is used together with
% the slope ratio method for guessing initial step sizes. Additionally a bunch
% of checks are made to make sure that exploration is taking place and that
% extrapolation will not be unboundedly large.

INT = 0.1;    % don't reevaluate within 0.1 of the limit of the current bracket
EXT = 3.0;                  % extrapolate maximum 3 times the current step-size
MAX = 20;                         % max 20 function evaluations per line search
RATIO = 10;                                       % maximum allowed slope ratio
SIG = 0.1; RHO = SIG/2; % SIG and RHO are the constants controlling the Wolfe-
% Powell conditions. SIG is the maximum allowed absolute ratio between
% previous and new slopes (derivatives in the search direction), thus setting
% SIG to low (positive) values forces higher precision in the line-searches.
% RHO is the minimum allowed fraction of the expected (from the slope at the
% initial point in the linesearch). Constants must satisfy 0 < RHO < SIG < 1.
% Tuning of SIG (depending on the nature of the function to be optimized) may
% speed up the minimization; it is probably not worth playing much with RHO.

% The code falls naturally into 3 parts, after the initial line search is
% started in the direction of steepest descent. 1) we first enter a while loop
% which uses point 1 (p1) and (p2) to compute an extrapolation (p3), until we
% have extrapolated far enough (Wolfe-Powell conditions). 2) if necessary, we
% enter the second loop which takes p2, p3 and p4 chooses the subinterval
% containing a (local) minimum, and interpolates it, unil an acceptable point
% is found (Wolfe-Powell conditions). Note, that points are always maintained
% in order p0 <= p1 <= p2 < p3 < p4. 3) compute a new search direction using
% conjugate gradients (Polack-Ribiere flavour), or revert to steepest if there
% was a problem in the previous line-search. Return the best value so far, if
% two consecutive line-searches fail, or whenever we run out of function
% evaluations or line-searches. During extrapolation, the "f" function may fail
% either with an error or returning Nan or Inf, and minimize should handle this
% gracefully.
