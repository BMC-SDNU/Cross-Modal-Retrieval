Unfortunately, the original code cannot be shared, due to the Tencent Youtu Lab's IP policy.  <br /> 
Instead, another MATLAB implementation of FSH has been released, which details are similar to the original version, but it would be still useful and gives similar results.

This package contains cleaned up codes for the CVPR paper, including:  <br />
test_FSH.m: the demo test codes on UCI dataset <br />
trainFSH.m: function to train the FSH model  <br />
UCI.mat: original UCI dataset
