# Usage
Run our script to train and test:
 
    JGRHML.m

The parameters are as follows:

    I_tr: the feature matrix of image instances for training, dimension : tr_n * d_i
    T_tr: the feature matrix of text instances for training, dimension : tr_n * d_t
    I_te: the feature matrix of image instances for test, dimension : te_n * d_i
    T_te: the feature matrix of text instances for test, dimension : te_n * d_t
    trainCat: the category list of data for training, dimension : tr_n * 1
    testCat: the category list of data for test, dimension : te_n * 1
    alpha: parameter, default: 0.1
    beta: parameter, default: 1
    k: kNN parameter, default: 90
