Usage
For Wikipedia-Multiple dataset:

1.Generate the Comprehensive Distance-Preserving Autoencoders by using the code:Auto1.py
2. Get the best data after training by using the code:decoder.py
3. Unsupervised Cross-Modal Similarity Measurement is used to further improve the retrieval performance by using the code:Knn.py
